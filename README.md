# MVP Prediction Model

## Introduction
This repository hosts a predictive model aimed at identifying potential Most Valuable Players (MVPs) based on comprehensive player statistics. Utilizing a RandomForestClassifier, the model evaluates performances across several metrics to forecast MVP contenders.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For model development and data processing.
- **Pandas**: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For initial data exploration and analysis.

## Development Process
The journey began with data collection, focusing on a wide array of player statistics spanning several seasons. Initial challenges included handling missing data and ensuring data consistency. Feature selection played a crucial role, emphasizing the importance of certain statistics in MVP consideration.

Data preprocessing involved standardizing and normalizing inputs to fit the model's requirements. The RandomForestClassifier was chosen for its effectiveness in handling complex, non-linear relationships within the data.

Model evaluation and tuning were conducted rigorously, employing techniques like cross-validation and grid search to optimize hyperparameters. One notable challenge was balancing the model to accurately predict MVPs, a rare event in the dataset, without overfitting.
